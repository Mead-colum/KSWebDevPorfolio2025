		<h1>The Internet is less personal</h1>

	<p>The article “404 Page Not Found” by Kate Wagner talks about how far the internet has come a long way since its inception , where user generated content meant "a lack of restriction on what the page could or should look like.",however as time passes corporations make cleaner and more restricted websites and exactly as the article states, "Such a degree of customization is extremely rare today". I agree, the internet’s humble beginnings have quickly turned into more of a tool to push certain narratives and financial choices onto it’s users and user made sites that aren’t made to sell you something “burying on the 112th page of search results anything on the web that is even remotely interesting—especially anything amateur, anything ad hoc-ist” - 404 Page Not Found</p>

	<h2>User Content Generated</h2>
	<p>User websites have become a rarity on the web nowadays. Most user generated content has been relegated to websites governed by privately owned companies, a stark difference to the geocities of yesteryear. Take facebook for example, a profile consists of a user’s profile picture, bio, photos, videos, friends and all with the same color scheme as everyone else’s profiles “Nothing about your account is different or more special than anyone else’s.”.On the other hand myspace profiles allowed unique backgrounds, background colors, borders, music players and more. However facebook provided ease of access and myspace’s often colorful profiles began to appeal less to the growing generation of users, and in the words of Kate Wagner “Myspace’s user-base comprised tweens and teens—young people eager to become adults. Myspace was soon to be known as “so middle school,” a shameful period in our lives that we’d all rather forget. And gone it is.”

	
	<h2>Big Companies</h2>
	<h4>Private</h4>
	<p> Back to privately owned websites, like twitter and facebook as they are the easiest way to get your opinions and and works to a wider audience they are the preferred place to talk. Twitter is often held as a ‘free speech platform’ however due its nature of being privately owned it isn’t exactly as free as it may seem. Despite being held as a digital townsquare, it and its users have often been subject to censorship from its’ owner. Privately owned social media aren't the only culprits however as even websites such as youtube are often at the whim of their host or in youtube’s case, it’s owner, google. </p>

	<h4>Public</h4>
	<p>Big companies like Google don’t care about creating a space for people to express themselves, more often than not they are trying to monetize people’s attempts to express themselves, ”These companies and platforms operate in part by devouring, appropriating, monetizing, exterminating”. Part of a big companies’ plan is to force dependence on it, Google has been on record making deals to be the default search engine for phone manufacturers. The biggest offense of these companies is the predatory collection of data, which is either sold to brokers or used to recommend targeted ads to users.</p>

	<h2>Overall</h2>
	<p>Overall the internet remains a place to express your opinions and view others’ opinions, but you’ll have to put extra effort seeking out these spaces as they often are pushed past the first few pages of the more common browsers. The new normal is clean websites governed by people who make more money than the average person will see in a lifetime, people who couldn’t relate to the average user if they tried. Overseers who think of the billions of users not as people but as potential paychecks. The internet is becoming more and more sterile but as a user you can at least replicate the old net, despite the corporate takeover, you can still use the net freely. So while some of the personality of the net has been ripped away, I think we should hold onto what we still have instead of lamenting what we lost. Because as long as we continue to learn the language of computers, the internet continues to hold some personality.</p>
